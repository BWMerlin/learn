We now have a very basic, though complete page! Much more can still be done to further improve this page. Continue digging through the documentation to learn how to get even deeper and add more feature to your pastry page :

- [Use the Sprunjing to paginate the results](/database/data-sprunjing)
- [use ufForm to create, edit and delete entries](/client-side-code/components/forms)
- [Create some tests](/advanced/automated-tests)
- [Create a custom Bakery command](/advanced/custom-cli)

## Source code

You can find the finalized code from this tutorial on GitHub.
