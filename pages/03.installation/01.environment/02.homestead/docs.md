If this is your first time installing UserFrosting or if you're not already familiar with setting up a local environment, this page will guide you in setting up your first local environment using Homestead. If you already have a local environment and you're already familiar with **composer**, the [Native Installation](/installation/environment/native) guide is for you.

## Setting up Homestead

Install [Vagrant](https://scotch.io/tutorials/get-vagrant-up-and-running-in-no-time) and [Homestead](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-laravel-homestead).

After you've set up Vagrant and Homestead, installation is the same as that for a [native environment](/installation/environment/native#GetUserFrosting).
