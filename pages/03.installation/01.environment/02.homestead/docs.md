If this is your first time installing UserFrosting or if you're not already familiar with setting up a local environment, this page will guide you in setting up your first local environment using Homestead. If you already have a local environment (e.g., LAMP or LEMP) and you're already familiar with **composer**, the [Native Installation](/installation/environment/native) guide is for you.

## Why you need a development environment

We get it - you just want to get UserFrosting up and running as quickly as possible.  Don't worry!  We'll get you there.

If you're uploading your code to a live site while you're still writing it, this section is for you. If you are already developing in a local environment, please skip this section.

### Web hosting vs. web server

In actuality, "web server" and "web hosting" are not the same thing. A web server is nothing more than a piece of software that runs on a computer and listens for **HTTP requests**.  The most common web servers - Apache and Nginx - are completely free and open-source.  You can download and run them on your personal computer.  

When you sign up with a web hosting company, you're not paying for the web server software; you're paying to run a web server on _their computers_ instead of your own.  The reason that you need a web hosting service is **not** because they possess some magical ability to run PHP.  What you're paying for is:

- Hardware maintenance and reliable uptime
- Better network connections, superior bandwidth
- Static IP addresses
- Support services (backup, monitoring, etc)

These are important concerns - and part of the reason that most people don't run their web applications off of a home/office server - but they have nothing to do with the _development_ of your application.

### Using a local server to view and test your code

In the long run, the amount of time you'll spend uploading your code after each change you make will **easily dwarf** the amount of time it takes to set up a working test server on your own computer.  Examples of test server software are Apache and Nginx. If you don't like the idea of setting up a local test server, there's an alternative option that is a little easier and very reliable, called a virtual environment. Vagrant and Homestead (using them together) is an example of setting up a virtual environment.  

When you run your code in a place that is accessible only to you and where it's ok when something breaks, this is referred to as a **development environment.**  When you upload your so that it is running live and interacting with real visitors to your site, this is called a **production environment.**


### Setting up Homestead

1. Install [Vagrant](https://scotch.io/tutorials/get-vagrant-up-and-running-in-no-time). Make sure that the directories you map in `Homestead.yaml` exist _before_ you run `vagrant up`.  Otherwise, you will need to reload your virtual machine using `vagrant reload --provision` so that Homestead has a chance to find your directories.
2. Install [Homestead](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-laravel-homestead)
