### We're not wordpress
The process of setting up UserFrosting so that you can begin work in your [local development environment](/background/develop-locally-serve-globally) is known as **installation**.  This is a separate process from [deployment](/going-live/deployment), which is when you actually push your fully developed application to a live server.  Please be sure that you understand this distinction before proceeding further!  UserFrosting is not like, for example, Wordpress, where you can "install" directly to your production server.

### Choose your poison
The links below will guide you to the right installation guide for you, which can be a little different depending on your dev environment.
